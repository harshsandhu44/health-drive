# Health Drive

## 1. Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a B2B SaaS platform designed for healthcare facilities. The platform aims to streamline appointment management, department and staff organization, and patient communication. The MVP will leverage Next.js with TypeScript, Clerk for authentication, Supabase for the database, Twilio for messaging, shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS for UI, and Framer Motion for animations.

## 2. Objectives

- Enable healthcare facilities to manage patient appointments efficiently.
- Organize departments and staff (doctors and non-departmental staff) within the facility.
- Facilitate appointment-related communication with patients via SMS using Twilio.
- Deliver a secure, scalable, and user-friendly platform for healthcare administrators.

## 3. Target Audience

- Healthcare facility administrators (e.g., hospitals, clinics).
- Department heads and scheduling staff.
- Doctors and support staff interacting with the platform.

## 4. Key Features

### 4.1 Appointment Management

- **Description**: Facilities can create, update, cancel, and view patient appointments.
- **Functionality**:
  - Admins/staff can schedule appointments with a doctor, specifying date, time, and patient details.
  - Patients are identified by name, email, and phone number.
  - Appointment status: Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled, Completed.
  - View appointments by day, week, or month in a calendar interface.
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Store appointments in Supabase with fields: `id`, `patient_id`, `doctor_id`, `date`, `time`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.

- **Functionality**:
  - Create, update, and delete departments (e.g., Cardiology, Pediatrics).
  - Assign doctors and staff to departments.
  - View department details, including assigned personnel.
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Supabase table for departments: `id`, `name`, `facility_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.

  - UI with shadcn/ui for department CRUD operations.

### 4.3 Staff Management

- **Description**: Manage doctors and staff, with or without department affiliation.
- **Functionality**:
  - Add/edit staff profiles with details: name, email, phone, role (doctor/staff), department (optional).
  - Role-based access: Admins manage all staff; doctors/staff view their schedules.
  - Staff metadata stored in Clerk for role and facility affiliation.
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Clerk metadata for user roles (`admin`, `doctor`, `staff`) and `facility_id`.
  - Supabase table for staff profiles: `id`, `user_id` (Clerk ID), `name`, `phone`, `department_id` (nullable).
  - Sync Clerk user creation with Supabase profile via webhook (per Clerk-Supabase integration guide).

### 4.4 Patient Messaging

- **Description**: Send appointment reminders and updates to patients via SMS.
- **Functionality**:
  - Automated SMS for appointment confirmation, reminders (24 hours prior), and cancellations.
  - Manual message sending by admins/staff for custom updates.
  - Message templates for consistency (e.g., "Your appointment with Dr. [Name] on [Date] at [Time] is confirmed.").
- **Technical Requirements**:
  - Twilio API integration for SMS delivery.
  - Supabase edge function to trigger Twilio API calls on appointment CRUD operations.
  - Store message logs in Supabase: `id`, `appointment_id`, `patient_phone`, `message`, `status`, `sent_at`.

## 5. Technical Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js (App Router, TypeScript, src directory), shadcn/ui, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion.
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, edge functions).
- **Authentication**: Clerk.js with metadata for roles and facility affiliation.
- **Messaging**: Twilio for SMS.
- **Hosting**: Vercel for Next.js deployment, Supabase for database.

## 6. Data Model

### Supabase Tables

- **facilities**: `id`, `name`, `address`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
- **departments**: `id`, `name`, `facility_id`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
- **staff_profiles**: `id`, `user_id` (Clerk ID), `name`, `phone`, `department_id` (nullable), `created_at`, `updated_at`.
- **patients**: `id`, `name`, `email`, `phone`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
- **appointments**: `id`, `patient_id`, `doctor_id`, `date`, `time`, `status`, `created_at`, `updated_at`.
- **message_logs**: `id`, `appointment_id`, `patient_phone`, `message`, `status`, `sent_at`.

### Clerk Metadata

- **User Metadata**: `role` (admin/doctor/staff), `facility_id`.

## 7. User Interface

- **Dashboard**: Overview of upcoming appointments, department stats, and staff availability.
- **Appointments Page**: Calendar view, form for scheduling, and list of appointments.
- **Departments Page**: List of departments with CRUD functionality and staff assignments.
- **Staff Page**: Staff directory with role filters and profile management.
- **Messaging Page**: View message logs and send manual messages.
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui for forms, tables, modals; Tailwind CSS for styling; Framer Motion for animations (e.g., page transitions, modal pop-ups).

## 8. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Security**:
  - Clerk for secure authentication and role-based access control.
  - Supabase Row-Level Security (RLS) to restrict data access by `facility_id` and user role.
- **Performance**:
  - Optimize Next.js for fast page loads with SSG/SSR where applicable.
  - Supabase queries optimized with indexes on frequently accessed fields.
- **Scalability**:
  - Supabase for scalable database operations.
  - Twilio for reliable messaging at scale.
- **Accessibility**:
  - Follow WCAG 2.1 guidelines for UI components.
  - Ensure shadcn/ui components are keyboard-navigable.

## 9. Integration Details

- **Clerk-Supabase**:
  - Use Clerk webhooks to sync user data with Supabase `staff_profiles` (per Clerk documentation).
  - Store `facility_id` and `role` in Clerk metadata for access control.
- **Twilio**:
  - Integrate Twilio SDK in Next.js API routes or Supabase edge functions.
  - Secure Twilio credentials using environment variables.
- **shadcn/ui & Tailwind**:
