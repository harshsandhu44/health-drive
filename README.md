# Health Drive

## 1. Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the Minimum Viable Product (MVP) for a B2B SaaS platform designed for healthcare facilities. The platform streamlines appointment management, department and staff organization, patient communication, and subscription plan management. The MVP leverages Next.js with TypeScript, Clerk for authentication and organization metadata, Supabase for the database, Twilio for messaging, Paytm for billing, shadcn/ui with Tailwind CSS for UI, and Framer Motion for animations.

## 2. Objectives

- Enable healthcare facilities to manage patient appointments efficiently.
- Organize departments and staff (doctors and non-departmental staff) within the facility.
- Facilitate appointment-related communication with patients via SMS.
- Provide subscription plans (Starter, Pro, Business) managed via a custom Paytm-based billing system.
- Deliver a secure, scalable, and user-friendly platform for healthcare administrators.

- Healthcare facility administrators (e.g., hospitals, clinics).
- Department heads and scheduling staff.
- Doctors and support staff interacting with the platform.
